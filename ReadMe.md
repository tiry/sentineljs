### Principles & Initial Design

#### Components

 - API Server: will expose a rest API
 - Services: encapsulate logic 
    - OpenCV BoundingBox managemnt
    - Storage of JSON and Blobs

#### Implementation 

This project will use JavaScript.
Although I had the opportunity to write a lot of javascript for several years, I have never started a backend project in NodeJS: seemed like a good opportunity to test and see how it goes.

This way, whatever the outcome, I will have learned something.

In terms of framework, not sure what the latest hipster framework is, but I will go for something simple with Express.

It seems (for now) like a good choice because:

 - I do not need to do complex stuffs : express shoule be enough
 - I expect the framework to be lighweight enough to not get in the way

### Build & Run

...

### WorkLod

#### Step1 - Bootstrap

Use `express-generator` for that and cleanup everything that is not needed.



#### Step2 - Unable file upload
